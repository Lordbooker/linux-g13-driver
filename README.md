# Readme File

I forked the repo because parts of it are already 10 years old, and I still tinker with the hardware.
So far, I have done a refactoring of the driver itself (modern C++ Standards) and the GUI (build process for Java 17 and maven / code base is now modern Java standards). 

## Requirements

### libusb-1.0 (recommended for the driver)

For Ubuntu and other Debian based systems, it should be installed already but if you don't have it, you can get it by typing:

    sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0

For Arch Linux and other Arch based systems you can install it by typing:

    sudo pacman -S libusb

For Fedora and other Fedora based Systems you can install it by typing:

    sudo dnf install libusb


### Java version 17 or higher (needed only for the GUI)

For Ubuntu and other Debian based systems, it can be installed by typing:

    sudo apt-get install default-jre

For Arch and other Arch based systems, it can be installed by typing:

    sudo pacman -S jre-openjdk

For Fedora and other Fedora based Systems, it can be installed by typing:

    sudo dnf install java-latest-openjdk.x86_64


## Build

Open a console (command prompt)  
Go to the directory where you unzipped your download  

type `make all` to build the driver
then type `make install` to write the UDEV-Rule

for cleaning up 
use `make clean`
and `make uninstall`

this will delete the build-files, the driver an the UDEV-Rule.


## How to use the driver and the GUI App

### Use the driver buildin Mappingset for mapping with other external tools like "Input Remapper"

The driver has now a fixed mapping in the driver itself, so you don't need the old GUI. 
You can now map with every other tool, like "Input Remapper".
( Only the quick change with the four small Buttons under the display doesn't work anymore. This works only with the GUI tool.)


### Manually made your own Mappingset

If you don't want to use the GUI App, just copy the Folder ".g13" from /bindings to your 'home' Directory. 
So you can make entries manually in the files.

In the 'docs' folder is an example List for Eventcodes.
Usage Example:

    If you want to map the G20 key on your G13 to the T key on the keyboard:
    Find T in the table. The Event Code is 20.
    Open your bindings-0.properties file.
    Add or change the following line: G20=p,k.20.


### Use the config tool
  
In a command prompt go to the directory where you unzipped your download and type:

    java -jar Linux-G13-GUI.jar

This will bring up the UI and create the initial files needed for your driver.  
All config files are saved in `$(HOME)/.g13`

The top 4 buttons under the LCD screen select the bindings.
The joystick currently only supports key mappings


### Run the driver

In a command prompt go to the directory where you unzipped your download and type:

If you have set the UDEV Rules, you now can start the driver with 

    ./G13-Linux-Driver 

else without UDEV-Rule Installation

    sudo -E ./G13-Linux-Driver

The `-E` is to run it using your environment variables so it doesn't look for the `.g13` directory in `/root`  
If you want to run the command and then detach it so you can close the terminal:

    sudo -E ./G13-Linux-Driver &

If you are configuring the application while the driver is running, the driver will not pick up changes unless you select a different bindings set or you can restart the driver.


## Notes

I've tried this on 64-bit Arch Linux and it works so far.
